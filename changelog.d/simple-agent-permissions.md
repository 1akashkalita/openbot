### Changed

- Set what an agent may do with one Permissions setting in its agent settings: Workspace only, Ask
  first or Full access. Ask first gives the agent full reach, and it asks you before it uses an
  OpenBot tool or publishes a site, and when its provider asks for approval. A new Claude agent
  shows Workspace only and Full access, because Claude does not ask for approval with full reach.
  On a joined server, an owner or admin can change the Permissions of its agents.
- Full access agents now publish, update and delete public sites and use built-in tools without
  asking, as Turbo mode did before. Before, only Turbo mode let an agent do this without asking.
- A Claude agent with Auto approve off shows Ask first. It asks before it uses an OpenBot tool or
  publishes a site, as before, but Claude's own tools run without asking. Select Full access or
  Workspace only to change it.
- "Always allow" on an approval card shows only at Ask first, and moves the agent to Full access.

### Removed

- Remove Turbo mode from General settings and the Auto approve switch from the model menu. Each agent
  keeps what it could do: an agent with Turbo mode on before the upgrade has Full access.
