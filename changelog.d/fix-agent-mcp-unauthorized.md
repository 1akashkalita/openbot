### Fixed

- An OpenCode agent with more than one chat keeps its OpenBot tools. Before, about 10 minutes after
  its other chat went idle, every OpenBot tool call failed with `{"error":"unauthorized"}`, including
  routines, teammates and the browser, until OpenCode restarted. Each tool call also runs in the chat
  that made it, when two chats of the agent work at the same time.
